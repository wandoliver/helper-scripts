To assign a root user password with Linux Mint use this command:

"sudo mysql -u root"

At the mysql> prompt see what is the authentication.

"SELECT user,host,authentication_string,plugin FROM mysql.user WHERE user='root';"

To change root to password authentication — change the ‘password’ at the end to your actual password within the quotes.

"ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH 'mysql_native_password' BY 'password';"

You should execute FLUSH PRIVILEGES after making manual edits to tables such as MySQL.

"FLUSH PRIVILEGES;"

Then just Quit.

"quit"
